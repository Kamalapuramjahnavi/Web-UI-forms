# Web-UI-forms
Creating a basic WEB UI frontend  application that can be able to create, show and delete records from  UI.
# Installation
I have installed Visual Studio Code for the html,css, code implementation.
# Usage 
 I have written separate codes for html and css in the visual studio code as different files and I have given css link in html to connect style sheet with html.
 HTML is used for documentation and CSS is used for styling and adding additional look to the main page.
